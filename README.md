Hereâ€™s a more detailed flow chart that outlines the high-level approach for mapping user logins (email addresses) to individual S3 buckets using Auth0 for authentication. This visualization will help clarify the sequence of operations and the interactions between different components.

### Flow Chart Description

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - User registers or logs in via the front-end.
   - Auth0 authenticates the user and returns a JWT.

2. **Token Verification and User Mapping**:
   - The front-end sends the JWT to your backend server.
   - The backend verifies the JWT with Auth0.
   - The backend checks the user database for an associated S3 bucket.

3. **S3 Bucket Interaction**:
   - If a bucket exists, the server provides access to it.
   - If no bucket exists (new user), the server creates a new S3 bucket and updates the database.

4. **User Interaction with S3**:
   - The server generates and sends pre-signed URLs or credentials to the front-end for direct S3 access.
   - Users use these credentials to interact with their S3 bucket directly for uploading or downloading files.

This flow chart focuses on a scenario where each step is connected to ensure user authentication, bucket management, and secure file access. This architecture maintains security and separation of concerns, using Auth0 for robust authentication, your backend for logic and AWS interaction, and direct S3 access for scalability and performance.
